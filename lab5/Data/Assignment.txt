ASSIGNMENT

The QKD protocol used is the 3-state 1-decoy efficient BB84 protocol described in [1].
The transmitter (Alice) send the state a encoded in the base A={X,Z}. In particular, a={H,V} if A=Z and a=D if A=X.
The receiver (Bob) chooses the measurement base B={X,Z} and can obtain the state b={H,V} if B=Z or b={D,A} if B={X}.

In order to characterize the QKD system, you need to estimate the following quantities:
- The probability that the transmitter encodes in the base X, prob(A=X)
- The probability that the transmitter encodes in the base Z, prob(A=Z)
- The probability that the receiver chooses the base X, prob(B=X)
- The probability that the receiver chooses the base Z, prob(B=Z)
- All the possible conditioned probabilities at the receiver, prob(b|a) where b={H,V,D,A} and a={H,V,D}
- The Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) achieved in the state H, prob(a!=b|a=H)
- The Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) achieved in the state V, prob(a!=b|a=V)
- The Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) achieved in the state D, prob(a!=b|a=D)
- The Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) achieved in the base X, prob(a!=b|A=X, B=X)
- The Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) achieved in the base Z, prob(a!=b|A=Z, B=Z)
- The probability that the decoy state is the low intensity state, prob(decoy=low)
- The probability that the decoy state is the high intensity state, prob(decoy=high)

You can find the experimental data of the transmitter and receiver in the files "states.txt" and "statesRCV.txt", respectively.
The "no-detections" events due to the channel attenuation are already discarded, hence you have a direct correspondece between what the transmitter has sent and the related measurement of the receiver.

Data are saved as follows: 
- states.txt. Here the transmitted states are saved. The states are encoded as H = '00', V = '01', D = '10', A = '11', and they are embedded into 8 bit. For example, the state D is saved as '00000010'. This file must be read byte by byte. 
- statesRCV.txt. Here the received states are saved. The encoding is the same as states.txt. This file must be read byte by byte.
- decoy.txt. Here the encoded decoys are saved. The decoy levels are encoded as null = '00', low = '01', high = '10', and they are embedded into 8 bit. For example, the decoy high is saved as '00000010'. This file must be read byte by byte (you should not find any null decoy).

Facultative:
Let's suppose that you have a perfect channel which does not introduce any errors, which means prob(a=b|A=B)=1 and prob(b=D|A=Z)=prob(b=A|A=Z)=prob(b=H|A=X)=prob(b=V|A=X)=0.5.
An eavesdropper intercepts the photons along the channel fiber and he measures with the same probabilities of Bob in the base E={X,Z}. 
After the measurement, he sends to Bob the state e measured by him. What are the QBERs experienced by Alice and Bob in this intercept and resend attack? Is our system secure against this type of attack?

If you have any questions, please ask. Good work!
